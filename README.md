# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
### Overview of the project
Determine number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are able to participate in mentorship program. The purpose is to prepare Bobby's manager for the outflux of current employees as many of them are reaching retirement age.
### Results
####From the retiring_titles table (https://github.com/karanpreetjaggi/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Queries/retiring_titles.csv). It seems alot of employees are near retirement for a lot of titles.The highest number of retiring titles being Senior Engineer with around 15600 employees nearing retirement and the lowest being the 501 in Assistant Engineer.
####From the mentorship_eligibilty (Data/mentorship_eligibilty.csv). This explains which employees are eligible for mentorship program. Total number of mentorship program acroaa all titles is 1549. The interesting field that we have used to select current employee is to_date. The data is spread across various titles.
### Summary
Total number of mentorship eligibilities would be good to see irrespective of the titles. 
It would be a great help to see which employee is actually is retiring vs mapping out which title. Using title retiring ia confusing to me as each individual mapped out queries in different ways.
